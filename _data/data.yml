career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently working as a Data Scientist at Analyse2 Oyj. Our team consisting of 4 data scientists is responsible for developing 
      a machine learning engine forecasting sales for our FMCG customers. We develop, build, deploy and maintain the whole ML service as 
      well as the time series forecasting models. Data analysis, code and performance testing and data engineering are all part of our 
      daily work routines; some might call this "full stack data science". 
education:

    info:
      - degree: M.Sc. in Computational Materials Physics
        university: University of Helsinki
        time: 2019 - 2021

          During my master's degree I focused a lot on statistics, machine learning and data science along my computational physics courses. 
          In my master's thesis I generated machine learning interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations using gaussian process 
          regression (Gaussian Approximation Potentials). The potentials were generated for WMoTa concentrated alloys for computational research 
          on radiation effects of these materials. The input data was done with DFT simulations.
            - Research assistant in Soft Matter group; did MD simulations of nanodiscs and phospholipid bilayers
            - Master's thesis in Computation Materials Research group; Machine Learning, MD, DFT, Gaussian processes
      - degree: B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics
        university:  University of Helsinki
        time: 2014 - 2019
        details: |
          Bachelors studies consisted of a lot of mathematics and mathematical methods and statistical analysis, as well as in depth courses 
          on physics. I had a wide range of range of subjects and gained deep understanding of physical phenomena, and studies included also methodological 
          courses teaching scienctific computing and optimization. I also studied programming and had studies from computer science department on software 
          engineering, databases, data structures and algorithms and so on. 
            - Worked as a teaching assistant; courses included Mathematical methods (complex analysis, function theory, fourier analysis) and electrodynamics
            - B.Sc. thesis on the three body problem and it's choreographical solutions
